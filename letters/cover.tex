% Introduction
\paragraph{
I'm excited to apply for the Distributed Computing Application Engineer role at Qube Research \& Technologies. With a background in computer science, hands-on experience in high-performance computing, and a real interest in scalable systems, I think this opportunity is a great match for my skills and passion.}
\paragraph{
  Right now, I'm studying Computer Science at RWTH Aachen University and working as a student developer at Redcare Pharmacy. I’ve built automation tools for processing E-prescriptions, created testing environments, and developed scripts to streamline data handling—all aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency. I also enjoy working on complex computing problems; during my recent HPC project, I optimized parallel algorithms like Sparse Matrix Multiplication and K-Means to run efficiently on clusters using OpenMP.
}
\paragraph{
  I'm comfortable working with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Python, and Conda, and I’ve had experience with both cloud platforms and large-scale systems. I’m also familiar with how distributed systems behave under different workload types, and I enjoy troubleshooting and optimizing them for performance.
}

\paragraph{
What draws me to QRT is the combination of cutting-edge tech and a scientific approach to solving real-world challenges. I’m eager to work with platforms like Ray and YellowDog, and to learn from and contribute to a team that’s pushing the limits of what distributed computing can do in finance.
}
\paragraph{
Thanks for considering my application. I’d love the chance to talk more about how I can support the team at QRT.}
